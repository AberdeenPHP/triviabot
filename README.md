# triviabot
Trivia bot that runs in a Slack channel.

To install run `composer require btk/triviabot dev-master`  on your server.

THIS PACKAGE IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT - seriously, it's not even ante-pre-alpha yet.
It's strongly recommended to make the root of your webserver/subdomain the folder triviabot/src/webroot as this will keep your db and config files etc away from prying eyes.
